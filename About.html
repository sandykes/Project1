            <p>Allahrakka Rahman (About this soundpronunciation (helpÂ·info); born A. S. Dileep Kumar on 6 January 1967),[1] known professionally as A. R. Rahman, is an Indian composer, singer and music producer who works predominantly in Tamil and Hindi movies. His works are noted for integrating Indian classical music with electronic music, world music and traditional orchestral arrangements. Rahman also introduced 7.1 surround sound technology to South Indian films.[2] He is nicknamed "Isai Puyal" (the musical storm) and "Mozart of Madras".[3]</p>

            <p> Rahman initially composed scores for different documentaries and jingles for advertisements and Indian television channels. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn.[31] He also arranged the jingles for some advertisements that went on to become very popular, including the popular jingle for Titan Watches, in which he used the theme from Mozart's Symphony no.25.[32][33][34]</p>
